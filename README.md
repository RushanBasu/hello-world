# hello-world
A place to store ideas, resources and to collaborate with others! 😊

My name is.. well this is the internet I am talking to. So it's better that y'all know me as Solemn Wolf.

I am a tech enthusiast and I love computers. 😀 (Ok thats 99% of the people in github.)
I specialise in Web development, Multimedia (Photo editing - Gimp, Blender, Video editing - DaVinci Resolve), Python, Unreal Engine and C++. I am currently learning a bit about penetration-testing using Kali Linux.

I also love playing chess and the drums. ♟️🥁
